# Issues

Eik is built up of multiple modules where some modules are just for internals and others not.

To make it easier to report issues without knowing the internals of Eik and which module
an issue should belong to, this repository act as a common issue tracker for all Eik repositorys.

Please file all issues, bugs and questions [here](https://github.com/eik-lib/issues/issues).
